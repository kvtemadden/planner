## Functionality
This planner works by giving the users 9 hours to plan for their working day.

The user is able to click into any field, which is colour coded based on the current time frame, and populate it.

The colour coding is based on whether the time, in comparision to the current hour, is in the:
- past - grey
- present - red
- future - green

The user can also save their populated field by clicking the save button adjacent to the field itself.

When the user reloads or revisits the page, this information will still be there.

The date at the top of the page also updates dynamically based on the current date.
